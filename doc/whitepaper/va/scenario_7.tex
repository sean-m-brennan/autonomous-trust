A veteran has previously clicked a preference for dietary advice in the \projectName interface app on his phone.
One day while sitting in a waiting room in the VA hospital, a notification pops up announcing a brand new service offering customized nutrition plans.
Once he clicks to accept, under the hood the system downloads a new schema from a well-trusted VA server which in turn spawns a new app that learns the veteran's eating preferences and cross-references that with recommendations from his medical chart.
\emph{No} personal health information is shared with the VA server and \emph{no} new executable is downloaded to his phone.
His frequent use of this app tells the VA how popular the program is, and his subsequent health improvements (or even lack thereof) gives all of his physicians more feedback for fine-tuning this veteran's care.
