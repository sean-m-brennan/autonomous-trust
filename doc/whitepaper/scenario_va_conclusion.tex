There are issues of decentralization we have not addressed, but which may become critical for certain instances of our system.
As an example in our VA use-case, for veterans that store everything on their phone, if the phone is lost, then what?
Here, the VA may continue (as it currently does) to act as data clearinghouse, and bootstrapping a new device and identity may be merely inconvenient for the veteran.
For other, more decentralized, instances however such an event could have disastrous consequences.
Backups to the cloud return us to all the problems of the old paradigm.
Non-expert users (and indeed non-competent users) need a solution, but this is the subject of further research.
