Abstract

Philosophy of Trust
===================

* Definition: the degree to which another's positive behavior is predictable. Two axes: pos/neg, order/chaos.
* Dynamic, not static. Ossification leads to sudden breakage instead of graceful degradation. 
* Ultimate purpose - cooperation/mutual security
* Balance of individual and collective 


Mechanisms of Trust
===================

Prerequisites:
* consistent identity
* shared language 

Dynamics:
* goal sharing and negotiation
* optimized bootstrapping (TF2T)
* building reputation
* scalability: low-, medium-, high-trust
* hierarchical prioritization (clannishness)


Failure Modes of Trust
======================

Authoritarian (via the hierarchy)
* mass deception
* censorship / silencing
* atomization
* heresy - false domain protocols

Individual (one-on-one [putatively])
* denouncing - reputation poisoning or negation
* shilling / spamming - muddying the water
* malicious targeting - high rep node bullying single/few others
* isolation - social network partition / cliquishness
* entryism - misrepresenting goals to gain acceptance/power


Social Fences
=============

Iron-clad ruleset: violation results in immediate dissolution of reputation (hard-coded, no appeal)
* freedom of association
  - no MitM blocking of communications (this may require each NIC to have a dedicated AT firmware router in front of it for spam control) [how to detect?]
  - can combat authoritarian attacks, if not already atomized
* rule of law
  - those higher up the hierarchy are held to a *stricter* standard
  - i.e. reputation thresholds for leaders are higher
* skin in the game
  - hierarchical leaders must be full participants in the domain they oversee
  - i.e. leaders that do not interface significantly with their subordinates lose reputation
* protocols / etiquette
  - vary by domain and relationship
  - broadcasts banned?
* selective legibility
  - furtive shibboleths 


Dispute Resolution
==================

* determining _truth_
* dialogue
* leader mediation - always local
* discipline - not solely exile


Machine Society ... with Human Participation
============================================

* Disconnect tolerant
* Humans are default local leaders/judges
