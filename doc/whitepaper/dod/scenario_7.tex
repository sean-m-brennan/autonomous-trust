Despite the odds, the squad has caught up with the target.
Unfortunately, the swarm vanguard has been spotted and enemy countermeasures are dropping micro-drones out of the sky.
A squad specialist requests that the swarms reform into two networks: one to distract the countermeasures, and the other, composed of only three drones, to acquire target triangulation.
The target is positively identified, but is (predictably) in a hardened position.
The squad cannot complete the mission directly.
Fortunately, Command scrambled a fighter jet immediately when the MQ-800 went rogue.
It arrives just in time, and announces itself, validates with the squad/swarm network, and acquires the targeting data all in less than one second.
The pilot fires and receives swarm-drone confirmation of success.
All this within the six seconds of a single, high-speed, low-level pass of the jet.
With just two drones left, the squad high-tails ti to the exfiltration point -- one drome looking ahead and the other watching their six.
The mission is successful with a major loss of electronics, but no casualties.
They never even saw the enemy face-to-face.
