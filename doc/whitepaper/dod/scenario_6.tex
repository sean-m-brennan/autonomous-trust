The RQ-86 drones drop out of cooperation mode and challenge the rogue drone with electronic countermeasures of their own.
Occasionally, randomly, they desist in order to check if friendly controllers can take over.
This is essentially a CTFT approach to keep the rogue under control.
Without human controllers, it just continues circling.
Because there are two of them, they are able to keep the MQ-800 disconnected from its hostile remote-controllers, but must remain near it to keep it neutralized.
However, the e-battle in the sky means that the squad on the ground is largely on its own.
