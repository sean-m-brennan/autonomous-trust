a battlefield teeming with autonomous, warfighter-carried, and remotely-controlled weapons and surveillance platforms.
This is the ultimate in hostile environments and potentially dire consequences.
The mission is for a single squad to infiltrate behind enemy lines and eliminate a very specific target, with intensive in-situ technological support.
However, the enemy knows you're coming, and is equivalently armed and supported.
When line-of-sight is frequently lost and equipment can be hacked, blocked, shot down, fried, or zombified -- how do you maintain operational security among whatever hardware survives, cohere its information into a unified and usable whole, and enable the team to not just survive but to complete the mission?
