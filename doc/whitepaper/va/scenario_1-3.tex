For our VA example, the network could be as simple as each veteran connecting to a single VA site and a single authorized private practice.
Or (more realistically) it may be as complicated as nine million veterans connecting to twelve hundred VA facilities and tens or hundreds of thousands of non-VA medical centers, any of which may directly interact.
