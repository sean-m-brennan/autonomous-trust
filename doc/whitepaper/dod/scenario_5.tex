The MQ-800 arrives and begins circling.
The higher altitude RQ-86s suddenly report much higher electronic noise.
Shortly after, the MQ-800, an impressive surveillance platform in its own right, begins feeding data down that directly contradicts the other drones.
Swarm and ground units (including squad processors) immediately start gossiping, concluding that the new arrival is not to be trusted.
These ground units cut off all messages coming from it just as those messages become a flood.
The RQ-86s also come to this conclusion and relay that up to Command.
