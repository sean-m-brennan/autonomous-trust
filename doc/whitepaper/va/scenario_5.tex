Simply by sharing patient records, the VA can observe veteran satisfaction without explicitly eliciting it.
The gossip function can provide the VA with high-quality, fine-grained, and massively-scaled feedback.
By gossiping with veteran's agents, and tying those evaluations back to individual transactions, VA staff can discover precisely what is going well and where problems may lie, and directly compare that to private practices both collectively and individually.
This of course presumes that the VA has earned the trust of the veteran's agent --- itself an indicator of performance.
