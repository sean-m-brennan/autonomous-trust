a battlefield teeming with autonomous, warfighter-carried, and remotely-controlled weapons and surveillance platforms.
This is the ultimate in hostile environments and potentially dire consequences.
The mission is for a single squad to infiltrate behind enemy lines and eliminate a very specific target, with intensive in-situ technological support.
However, the enemy knows you're coming, and is equivalently armed and supported.
