As the squad approaches the target's building, so far undetected, immobile leave-behind systems come in contact with their proximity networks.
Apparently, several of these systems had been found and hacked.
They now work for the enemy.
However, they present unknown identities and so are ignored by the network.
One undiscovered system successfully connects and provides data that leads the squad to conclude that the target has left recently.
Overhead reconnaissance data concurs, tracking a suspected relevant vehicle.
Additionally, swarm visuals indicate a potential ambush waiting in the building.
Thankfully the squad never had to enter, and is still undetected.
