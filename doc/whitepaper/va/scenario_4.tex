Veterans and VA staff already have official identities and a process for acquiring such.
Piggybacking off that system would be very simple.
External medical practitioners do not need to adopt VA identities --- nor do they need to expose their identity subsystem publicly.
The veteran can simply register an existing identity from a smartphone at the medical office, thereby acquiring a new subchain.
The veteran's agent is now a peer leader, bridging two enclaves.
Although the VA is the authority for identity generation, \projectName does not \emph{require} any authority.
