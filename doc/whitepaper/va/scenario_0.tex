As users of VA services, our veterans have prepaid the value of the transaction via service to our nation; yet many are willing to add more value in payment to receive a higher level of care.
This system not only enables veterans to take charge of their own care, as a side-effect it provides an apples-to-apples comparison between VA and private medical services, concrete performance metrics for individual VA sites and practitioners, and deep insight into the veteran's experience.
Such a system can empower the VA to provide the level of service that our veterans deserve, simply by responsibly sharing the patient-veteran's own records.
