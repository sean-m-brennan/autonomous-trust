In this scenario, the enemy has overrun formerly-held territory.
The squad has boots on the ground and is three klicks from the target's last known location.
All squad members have a heads-up display that incorporates all available data as geospatial targeting and sensory augmentation.
Two specialists in the squad carry line-of-sight laser comms, electronic countermeasures, and long range encrypted telemetry and voice comms.
Several swarms of autonomous micro-drones precede the squad just above the treetops, extending the squads detection capabilities.
Two autonomous RQ-86 reconnaissance drones are high above the vicinity, providing multimodal surveillance for the team and a gateway for cohort devices to access non-local resources.
A single, well-armed, remote-controlled MQ-800 drone is en route and due in four minutes.
A variety of leave-behind platforms may or may not be available as the squad proceeds.
