While the squad has the option of voice comms with their command structure, their primary network is low-power voice and data within tight proximity.
Swarm drones form proximity networks among their groups and with the squad, and listen to the reconnaissance drone, but do not respond to avoid triangulation.
Each RQ-86 drone is peer leader for the swarms, but also coordinates up to the command structure, as well as with each other.
When the remote controlled MQ-800 arrives, it will acquire information from the RQ-86s, but is otherwise independent.
Before the mission, identity and reputation chains and schemas sets are established, but all that can and will change in the field.
